 Tittle : VIRTUAL TIME CAPSULE
 
 **VIRTUAL TIME CAPSULE** is a Python-based application that allows users to create and store digital time capsules. 
  The project uses a variety of libraries to facilitate its features, including text, images, audio, and time-based capsules. 
  Users can preserve memories, thoughts, and experiences for future retrieval. This tool provides capsules for personal use, social moments,
  travel memories, event-based capsules, and even messages for future generations.

- **Travel Time Capsule**: Document travel experiences, including photos and personal reflections.
- **Event-Based Capsule**: Create capsules tied to specific events (e.g., weddings, birthdays).

## Libraries Used
- **Tkinter**: Provides the graphical user interface (GUI), including buttons, text inputs, and file dialogs.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Handles image processing, allowing users to upload and display photos as part of their capsules.
- **Datetime**: Manages dates and times for when capsules are created and when they should be opened.
- **PyAudio**: Records and saves audio clips that can be added to capsules.
- **JSON**: Stores data like text, images, and timestamps in a structured format.
